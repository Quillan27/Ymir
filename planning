TERRAIN

Seperate Map into tiles
- Delauney Triangulation?
- Poisson Sampling?
- Voronoi Things?

Select tiles to be a part of landmass
- All border tiles are ocean
- Tiles group up
- Grouping strength can be changed, all the way to a single island world

Apply basic Perlin noise to the Map
- enough for rough coastlines
- smooth enough for hills

Simulate erosion??

CLIMATE
- Add smooth perlin noise for randomness
- Add north to south gradient

BIOME
- Map climate, elevation, proximity to water to biomes
