# Ymir - A *Procedural* World **and** Map Generator

> "The gods Odin, Vili and VÃ© fashioned the Earth from Ymir's flesh, from his blood the ocean, from his bones the hills, from his hair the trees, from his brains my butts, from his skull the heavens, and from his eyebrows the middle realm in which mankind lives, Midgard."
